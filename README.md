# Minimal Portfolio
This repository shows all of the  code for my minimal portfolio website. It is built with React + Vite  and uses Tailwind CSS for styling. To check out the portfolio itself, it is being hosted by GitHub Pages via this link.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
